## Aesthetic Goals:
### Goal 1: Simplicity
**Definition:** The player should feel that the game is easy to pick up and play, with intuitive controls and clear objectives, allowing them to quickly understand how to progress without feeling overwhelmed.

#### Success:
- Players quickly understand what to do and can start engaging with the game immediately.
- The game mechanics are intuitive, allowing players to learn through gameplay rather than relying on lengthy tutorials or detailed instructions.

#### Failure:
- Players express confusion or frequently ask for clarification about how to play.
- Tutorials or instructions feel overly detailed and are skipped or ignored because players struggle to understand how they affect gameplay.
- The game has a steep learning curve that deters casual players.

### Goal 2: Competition
**Definition:** The player should feel a sense of excitement and motivation to outperform other players, making each competition thrilling and engaging.

#### Success:
- Players experience a rush of excitement during competitive moments, such as races or challenges.
- Players are motivated to replay sections to improve their performance and achieve better results.
- Players feel a sense of accomplishment and pride when they surpass their opponents.

#### Failure:
- The competition feels too easy or too hard, leading to boredom or frustration.
- Players feel unmotivated to compete, showing little interest in winning or losing.
- The competition lacks excitement, making races feel repetitive and dull.

## Core Loop:
### Running
- Obstacles spawn and move toward the player.
- The player jumps to avoid the obstacles.
- If successful, another obstacle spawns, increasing in speed or frequency.
- If the player fails to avoid an obstacle, the training ends. The player can then choose to try again for a higher score or move on to the next training event.
